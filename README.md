# Diabetes classification

This project entailed creating a classifier for predicting whether a person is diabetic or not.
Over the course of the project, the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and multiple classifiers are built. 
In the end, the two best-performing classifiers are Logistic Regression and Random Forest, which are then evaluated.
